# ID3-Implement
=============

A sample implement of ID3 algorithm, based on a bird flu samples, coded by C++ 11.

## Samples
### records
The samples are seven records of whether having bir flu and the features.

All the records are shown by the following picture:

### record file
For easily access the records, I use number to identify the states of features.Each number's meaning can be found in the above picture.

The records are storaged in the file './source/samples.txt', which has the following content:
```

1            0               1              1[
```

## Screenshots

The following picture shown the process of program:

As you can see, some calculation process was displayed.And at the end, the program outputed a decision tree, which generated by ID3 algorithm.
